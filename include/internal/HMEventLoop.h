     The Base class for the Event Loop.
     Derived classes should implement the following functions:
     runThread - called to init and start the event loop.
     shutDown - called to shutdown and cleanup.
     wakeupTracker - called to force the event loop to check to make sure the next entry did not change.
     getTimeoutQueueSize - returns the number of events in the loop.
     addDNTimeout - deals with scheduling a DNS lookup timeout.
     addHealthCheckTimeout - deals with scheduling a health check timeout.
