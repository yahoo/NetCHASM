//! Class that stores state maintained by each worker thread

    This class holds the persistent state for the worker threads. Store items that require init and shutdown processing.
    The reload state is called when a config reload is conducted by the state manager. Thus, cleanup and initilization can be
    done on variables that change with a config reload.
    Currently, the work state includes the worker thread id, an initialized Ares DNS lookup channel, and a pointer to the state manager.

//! Base class for all work classes
/*!
   This class is the basis for all work classes supported by NetCHASM.
   The class provides access to the current state, event queue, and state manager. Each work type must specify the target
   hostname, ip address, and checktype. The class maintains the thread id for debugging purposes and the check reason and response codes.
   Base classes must override the following functions:
   processWork - This function is called to actually conduct the work for the worktype
   init - This function is called once when the work is created
   getWorkType - called to return the type of work we are processing.

   Additionally, all base classes should call updateState before accessing the internal statemanager and eventqueue pointers to
   make sure the state is updated after a possible configuration reload.
