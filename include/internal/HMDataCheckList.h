//! Class to hold the list of health checks to perform
/*!
 * This is the main class that holds all health checks that NetCHASM will perform.
 * Checks are stored in a tiered structure to minimize the number of repeat checks.
 * HMDataCheckList -> Top level class holding all checks. Query by HostName, IPAddress and hostDataCheck.
 * Core data structure is a mapping of host name and hostDataChecks to the checkParams for the check.
 * HMDataHostCheck -> Stores the check URL, checktype and all information required to perform the check work.
 * Thus, the internal map contains a key/value pair for each individual piece of check "work" to perform.
 *
 * HMDataCheckParams -> Stores the variables for check timing, check updating and storage. This allows each check to be performed
 * with all individual rotation's check to be updated correctly even with different check parameters, averaging etc.
 *
 * HMDataCheckResults -> Stores the actual results of the checks
